# Java Weather App

## A Java weather app utilizing the Accuweather API

### About
- This was a practice exercise to learn how to use the Swing GUI form builder and making requests to API's 
- The desktop app reports the temperature highs and lows along with the a forecast summary for the day
- It still looks like Gradle does not support the bytecode generated by the form builder, luckily IntelliJ offers the option to use Java Source Code

- Also I didn't bother to hide the API key in an ENV variable, it was a demo key anyway.

### Software
- **Java & Swing** to make the interface and application
- **Gradle** to run unit tests (jUnit)
